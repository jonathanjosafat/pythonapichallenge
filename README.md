# pythonapichallenge
 
This challenge requires the creation of a Python script to visualize weather for over 500 cities with varying distances from the equator.  The OpenWeatherMap API was utilized to create a visualization of this data.
Several variables were analyzed to review it's correlation to the specific countrie's latitude.  The variables included temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed.
A linear regression line was computed for each scatterplot to help draw a better representation of the data.

For the VacationPy challenge, a map was created to display a point for every city in the dataframe.  This dataframe was also used to find nearby hotels to the coordinates provided in the code.  A map of this was created as well to provide a visualization of the data analyzed.
